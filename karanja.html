            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>
                I am Don Karanja, the CEO of Elitas Travel, a premier aircraft selling company. I served in the military airforce for two years, where I gained extensive experience in aircraft operations and logistics. Although I enjoyed my time in the airforce, I decided to transition to the private sector to pursue my passion for aviation and business. This led me to establish Elitas Travel, where I could leverage my expertise in a new and exciting way, contributing to the growth and innovation of the industry. My dedication to excellence and my vision for advancing the aviation sector have driven Elitas Travel to new heights.
